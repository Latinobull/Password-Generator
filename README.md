# Password-Generator

## Description

This a password generator made with Javascript. This website helps you create a secure password by adding factors that are decided by the user. The factors include character length, upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.

### How It Works

When you click on the button, a prompt shows up asking you how many characters you need in your password. You must enter a character amount between 8 and 128. If you choose a character amount outside those ranges or type letters instead of numbers, you will be alerted to try again. If you don't insert a valid number the second time, you will need to press the button again in order to generate a password.

After you decide the amount of character you need for your password, then you will be asked multiple questions for your password. The page will ask you if you need lower case letters, if you need upper case letters, if you need numbers, and if you need special characters in your password.

You must choose at least one of the criterias for the password to be created. If you choose no to all of the questions, you will see a message saying you will need to choose one criteria and press the button again to generate a password.
